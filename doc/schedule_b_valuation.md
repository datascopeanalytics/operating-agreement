SCHEDULE B

\

The valuation of the Company shall be determined by the Manager in
accordance with the provisions of this schedule on an annual basis at
the end of the Fiscal Year or at such other time as shall be provided
in the Agreement. As a basis for computing the valuation, the Manager
will use three common valuation techniques to guide its final
decision:

* a multiple of revenues based on [INSERT REVENUE MULTIPLIER RANGE]
  times revenues is an appropriate benchmark based on the current
  valuations of comparable companies,
* a multiple of EBIT based on [INSERT EBIT MULTIPLIER RANGE] times
  EBIT is an appropriate benchmark based on the current valuations of
  comparable companies, and
* a discounted cash flow model based on
  [INSERT DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW HORIZON] years of projected financials
  with the terminal value being calculated using an exit multiple
  methodology.

The valuation of the Company as determined by the Manager shall not be
greater than the largest of these techniques and not smaller than the
smallest of these techniques. 

\

Please note that the ranges on these multiples may be subject to change
due to a number of factors, including exceptionally high/low growth,
market conditions, or general economic conditions.
