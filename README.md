=== The basic idea

Datascope is structured so that we effectively "start a new company"
every year where each partner receives units in this "new company". In
our Operating Agreement, the units in this "new company" are
formalized as "Series B Units". We distribute these
units to partners in proportion to the amount of sweat equity they
have put into this "new company". As partners time contributions
basically become equal, partners become equal owners of each "new
company" and Datascope overall, which reflects a reality that the
business will change by adding more partners over time.

=== The way it works

Every December, the existing partners at Datascope decide which other
individuals would make outstanding partners. New partners are elected
by unanimous vote of the existing partners on whatever metrics each
partner deems fit.

At the end of the fiscal year, we agree upon a valuation which
[is some function of the financial performance of Datascope in the previous year](docs/schedule_b_valuation.md). Although
it isn't written into the
[Operating Agreement](docs/operating_agreement.md), we choose to issue
new Class B Units in proportion to the valuation of Datascope on the
1st of the year. Since these new Class B Units are profits interest
units that are issued at a specific valuation of Datascope, there are
no tax consequences for these new units &mdash; they are worth nothing
on day 1.

Although it isn't written into the
[Operating Agreement](docs/operating_agreement.md), we choose to
distribute these new Class B Units to all existing partners in
proportion to the amount of time they have been a partner. This has
the desireable propety to reward people that stay over time and
ultimately results in partners becoming equal owners in the business.

It is possible to set up things differently, but we chose to use our
units in three primary ways:

1. **Splitting profits.** At the end of the year, remaining profits
   are split among partners in proportion to the number of units each
   partner owns, regardless of the valuation at which they were
   issued.

2. **Decision making.** Each partner has voting rights in proportion
   to the number of units each partner owns, regardless of the valuation at
   which they were issued.

3. **Liquidation event.** Each partner receives proceeds from a
   liquidation event according to Section 15.4. TODO LAYMAN'S
   EXPLANATION WOULD BE NICE

=== Background

We were generally nonplussed by the "standard model" for adding
partners to a business, where new partners have to "buy in" by taking
out personal loans and are assigned a fixed number of shares that
mature over time. Particularly because these additions can be fraught
with arguments about how much value new individuals add and the skills
that they bring to the table. These arguments are extremely caustic to
otherwise productive relationships, particularly when everyone shares
the same goal of building a successful business together.

When we amended and restated our Operating Agreement from its original
(very standard) version, the goal was to make it easy to add new
partners in a fair and representative manner. We had two key concepts
in mind:

1. Adding new partners is about trust and confidence that they will
   make the business more profitable, plain and simple.
2. Partners should eventually become equal owners, in roughly 5-10
   years.
3. Founders and early partners should be rewarded for taking a risk.
4. We did not want it to be financially onerous to join Datascope as
   many talented data scientists may not have the financial
   means to take out a loan.

We are very fortunate to work with a fantastic accountant,
[Matt Taglia](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/matthew-taglia/6/763/250),
who happened to dig up a nugget in the IRS code about something called
"profits interest units". The basic idea behind profits interest units
is that they are only valueable if the company grows in value since
the date they are issued. Because they are tied to company valuation,
at first, they have no tax consequence which goes a long way toward
addressing issue #4 above.

With this in mind, we worked with an amazing (and patient!) attorney,
[Gene Bowen](http://www.bodmanlongley.com/attorneys.php?PeopleID=32),
that helped us craft an operating agreement that addressed our other
big-picture goals within the bounds of the law. We were responsible
for figuring out the math behind how we could achieve equal
partnership in 5-10 years and Gene drafted the legalese to address our
goals.
