[35,500,000 – 500,000 – 20,000,000].

\

A. Distribution to **Series January 1, 2012 Class B** Unit Holders and
Class A Unit Holders equals \$10,000,000
[**\$30,000,000****-****\$20,000,000**]. \$5,000,000 left to distribute.

Unit Holders equals remaining liquidation proceeds of \$5,000,000

available for distribution under Section 15.4 after taking into effect
the distributions to creditors under Section 15.4(i) is less than the
next highest Company Value at Issuance of **\$42,000,000**].

2012 Class B** Unit Holders and Class A Unit Holders equals \$0
[**\$1,900,000 -****\$2,000,000**]. Notice that, because the net
proceeds of liquidation available for distribution under Section 15.4
after taking into effect the distributions to creditors under Section
15.4(i) is less than the next highest Company Value at Issuance of
**Series January 1, 2013 Class B**, the series is worth \$0.
