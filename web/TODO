Features
========

* Add buttons to add another year with a value starting 10% higher
   than previous year (or should we just have 20 years to begin with?)

* change years to founding y0, y1, y2, ..., future to make it more
   generalizable

* use better tooltips

   * should display at vertical center on rectangles

   * should follow the dragged time slider

* use less space for the member timeline? maybe put all of the members
   on the same timeline. this would help put everything in the same
   view when the visual is opened

* maybe start with only two members to illustrate that the company was
   founded at a particular date? could be a better way of showing the
   difference between the first series of units and later series' of
   units
